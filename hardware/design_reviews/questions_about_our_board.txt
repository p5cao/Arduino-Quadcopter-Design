1. IMU Decoupling Capacitors

   
According to Prof. Swanson, "Ideally there should be no vias between a
   decoupling cap and the device." (See Piazza post @145)



Our answer: We have connected them directly without vias in between now.

2. Under the IMU, Layer 15

   
What is that yellow rectangle? Is it a trace? We are not sure.

Our answer: We have also built two cutouts within the IMU package, although we've already have the cutouts directly on the board. This will not hurt.




3. MCU Decoupling Capacitors

  
According to Prof. Swanson, "Ideally there should be no vias between a
   decoupling cap and the device." (See Piazza post @145)



Our answer: We have connected them directly without vias in between now.

4. There are name/value labels on vias throughout the board

   
For example, see R18, D14, D13, ...



Our answer: We have modified this problem.

5. LEDs

   
Traces N$37 and N$33 seem a bit sharp (e.g., 90 degree angles)



Our answer: We have rerouted our board based on a modified version and now no problems on this.

6. DRC

   
There are wire stubs that should be cleaned up (e.g., RES@3:GND)


Our answer: We have cleaned unnecssary wire stubs. Only two necessary ones are left (for antenna and NET_BRIDGE).
