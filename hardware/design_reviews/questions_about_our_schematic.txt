1. LED Connections

   
The wires between LEDs and current limiting resistors are of class default.
   As a result, they are only 5 mil (0.127 mm) wide on the board. Is that
   alright since the trace sizes connecting the LED-resistor branches to VBAT
   and NMOSFETs are 30 mil? 


Our answer: that's a mistake, and we have corrected it.
