Reviews for the Schematic drawing (Sudo_Wodoo)
-- reviewed by Yangsheng Hu and Pengcheng Cao (2019/05/01)

Section I: Power supply

1. you should use the provided VBAT symbol instead of define a VBAT label on you net conected to enable pin.

2. try not to divide your schematic into too many components.

Section II: Headers

1. Think maybe you could specify your two headers by telling reader which one is IMU rescue or connects to signal pins.

2. Again you should try to symbols provided like VBAT, BAT_GND instead of defining labels.

Section III: LEDs

1. Your LED symbols may be too big, the professor has suggested to make the symbols no bigger than size of 0.4 x 0.2 inch, which produces inconsistency between professor's LED symbols and yours.  

Section IV: Motor Drivers

1. Think you should mark you Schottky diodes with a "Flyback" dashed box.

Section V: Bootloader & FTDI programmer

Both seem fine.

Section V: MCU

All seem fine.

Section VI: IMU

1. Your IMU symbol may be problematic. You should only place power pins at the top and ground pins at the bottom.  Dont treat C1 and CAP as Grounds they still have caps connected.
