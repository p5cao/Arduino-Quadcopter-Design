We are choosing the LTST-C170 series of LEDs emitting red, yellow, and blue lights. The red, yellow, and blue LEDs are of the MFR number LTST-C170KRKT, LTST-C170KSKT, and LTST-C170TBKT respectively. We are planning to use the red LEDs as rear lights of our quad and both yellow and blue indicating the foward direction. In total 18 LED lights will be used, one red light on each of the rear rotor arms (X-type rotor layout), 4 blues on each of front rotor arms. We will place 2 yellow lights at the front of the drone airframe to indicate the forward direction and 2 blue lights on each of the other sides(left, right, and rear).

The Leds are connected to the 9th pwm pin on the microcontroller(PB4 pin) via the mosfet from our custom library, which is the Si302CDS N-Channel 20V (D-S) mosfet provided by Vishay Siliconix. We connect S-gate of the mosfet to pin 9 of the microcontroller, the G-gate to BAT_GND, and D-gate to all the parallel-connected LEDs. The total 18 LEDs will consume current of 450 mA, with 25 mA allocated to each to ensure at least 1.2 relative luminous intensity at high battery voltage(4.2V) and 0.9 relative luminous intensity at low battery voltage(3.7V). Each LED has a resistor serially connected to it to restrict the currents, and the power of LEDs is provided by V_BAT. We use the Ohm's law equation R = (V_source - V_LED)/I_LED to calculate the resistance required for choosing the resistors from DigiKey. 

The red and yellow LEDs have the maximum forward current of 25mA at maximum supply voltage(V_source) of 4.2V, which corresponds to 1.25 relative luminous intensity. The anticipated serial resistor to be used here will be 88 Ohm. We are choosing the YAGEO RC0805FR-0786R6L resistor with 86.6 resistance to connect to the diode. We need in total 14 resistors of this type.

The Blue LEDs also have the maximum forward current of 25mA (mapped to 1.2 relative luminous intensity on the curve), with the correspondng forward voltage of 3.5V and maximum supply voltage(V_source) of 4.2V. So based on Ohms Law we need to connect the Blue LED with a serial resistor of 28 Ohm. We shall choose to use YAGEO RC0805FR-0728RL resistor with exactly 28 Ohm resistance. We need in total 4 resistors of this type. 

All the resistors are selected from the same series, Yageo RC, as the resistor in the custom library we built before, and also share the same mounting pad sizes and footprint.
