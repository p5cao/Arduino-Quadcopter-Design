i. How quickly you are reading data from the IMU

The baud rate we use to transfer data through serial port from IMU is 19200 baud.

ii. Our ODR

The output data rate we chose to use is 238Hz.

iii. Our ODR ratio

The ODR ratio is chosen to be 4. 238hz ODR + 76 Hz LPF1 cutoff divided by 4. 78hz LPF2 cutoff if enabled.

iv. The cutoff frequencies for the accelerometer and gyro filters.


v. The configuration values you used for the registers you medified (written using the macros.)
